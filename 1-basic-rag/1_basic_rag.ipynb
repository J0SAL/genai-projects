              " Document(metadata={'source': 'https://www.asyncapi.com/about'}, page_content='About\\n\\nAsyncAPI\\n\\nAsyncAPI is an Apache License 2.0 library under the Linux Foundation that seeks to improve the current state of event-driven architecture (EDA). The AsyncAPI Initiative is a specification and growing set of open-source tools to help developers define, build, and maintain asynchronous APIs and EDAs.\\n\\nDevelopers familiar with OpenAPI (aka Swagger) for RESTful APIs will see strong similarities when using AsyncAPI. One common use case is generating asynchronous API documentation (HTML or Markdown). The specification is both platform and language agnostic. The current tooling includes support for common message brokers such as Apache Kafka and RabbitMQ and languages including Python, Java, and Nodejs.\\n\\nOur long-term goal is to make working with EDAs as easy as working with REST APIs. That goes from documentation to code generation, discovery to event management, and beyond. Our 150+ Open-Source (OSS) contributors are EDA enthusiasts from all around the world.\\n\\nThe AsyncAPI project started at Hitch (a.k.a. API Changelog). Hitch needed a machine-readable format to describe internal message-driven microservices architecture. The goal was to benefit from it in the same way they had used OpenAPI for their HTTP APIs. Inspired by OpenAPI, Fran Méndez, who worked at Hitch at the time, created the AsyncAPI specification. After publishing the first version, he noticed that he solved not only his problems but the problems of the wider community. Eventually, the AsyncAPI specification and community evolved into the AsyncAPI Initiative, a project now under the umbrella of the Linux Foundation.\\n\\nOpen governance model\\n\\nFree software allows users to apply, modify, and continue in the chain by distributing copies to help others and, in this case, disseminating modified versions of the specification.\\n\\nTransferring AsyncAPI to the Linux Foundation and forming an open governance model assures the community that a single company does not control AsyncAPI Initiative. This move takes the project to a higher level of transparency.\\n\\nIn doing so, we achieve:\\n\\nEnsuring an open governance model where no single company dominates the specification and its tools.\\n\\nMaking the project as democratic as possible.\\n\\nRelying on an asynchronous decision-making process that empowers the people who \"work,\" not the companies who \"pay.\"\\n\\nIn other words, it gives equal power to individual and corporate contributors.\\n\\nMaintainers\\n\\nCommitters (also known as Maintainers) are the decision-makers at the repository/project level. They regularly contribute to the project and are invited by other maintainers to manage the repository, have more privileges, and approve pull requests.\\n\\nThe committers run the repository, but for issues that go beyond that, there is a Technical Steering Committee (TSC). This committee comprises all the maintainers who voluntarily want to be part of this committee, thus taking responsibility for overseeing the initiative.\\n\\nYou can see the list of maintainers who also form part of the AsyncAPI TSC here.\\n\\nContributors\\n\\nWe do our best to recognize every contribution to the project.
